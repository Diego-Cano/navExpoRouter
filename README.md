# navExpoRouter

While working on this React Native app, I decided to go with a neat folder setup that keeps each page in its own space. It's like giving each part of the app its own room—keeps things tidy and easy to find. Using React Navigation's stack navigator felt like the right choice for moving around the app—it's pretty much the go-to for a reason.

I did run into a bit of a mix-up when the app kept showing the starter "Hello World" message instead of the cool screens I set up. Turns out, I had to tweak the starting point in the package.json file to fix it. But replacing it with the correct prop provided by React Navigation quickly set things straight.
